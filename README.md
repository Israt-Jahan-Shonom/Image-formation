# Image Formation
## Formation of a Black and White image
This Python script visualizes a black and white heart pattern represented by a 2D NumPy array using matplotlib. The array defines the pixel values of the pattern, where 1 represents a white pixel and 0 represents a black pixel.

[Here](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Image-formation/blob/main/Black_white_image.py) python script for black and white image formation is shown and output is shown [in this link](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Image-formation/blob/main/gray-heart.png).
## RGB Channel Separation
This Python script separates the Red, Green, and Blue channels of an RGB image and displays them alongside the original image using the matplotlib library.

[Here](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Image-formation/blob/main/RGB_band_separation.py) RGB channel separation script in python is given. Make sure you upload your own image at first. Output image of the separated channel is shown [in this link](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Image-formation/blob/main/separated_R_G_B.png).
### Colab link
Colab link for the python scripts are given [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S5e7pvgBUo079GqM3b5zmP19hYmeRAnz?usp=sharing).
## Satellite Bands
Some information on the bands of different satellites such as, Landsat, Sentinel and MODIS inculding their resolution, bands wavelength and description are tabulated [here](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Image-formation/blob/main/Satellite_bands.pdf).
