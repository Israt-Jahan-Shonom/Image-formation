# Image-formation
## Formation of a black and white image
This Python script visualizes a black and white heart pattern represented by a 2D NumPy array using matplotlib. The array defines the pixel values of the pattern, where 1 represents a white pixel and 0 represents a black pixel.
## RGB channel separation
This Python script separates the Red, Green, and Blue channels of an RGB image and displays them alongside the original image using the matplotlib library.
